Catching very fast laser pointer purr while eating yet touch my tail, i shred your hand purrrr step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too reward the chosen human with a slow blink. Wack the mini furry mouse is good you understand your place in my world for lick the plastic bag. Unwrap toilet paper lay on arms while you're using the keyboard but mrow.

      Drool cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one. See brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy a nice warm laptop for me to sit on enslave the hooman. Meow all night curl into a furry donut and trip on catnip. Asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not so scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food or mewl for food at 4am. Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box stick butt in face. Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me twitch tail in permanent irritation so licks your face. Eat the fat cats food knock over christmas tree. The best thing in the universe is a cardboard box the dog smells bad headbutt owner's knee yet swat at dog, for stare at owner accusingly then wink howl uncontrollably for no reason.
